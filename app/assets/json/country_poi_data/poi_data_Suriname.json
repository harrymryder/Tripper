[{"Name":"Paramaribo","Description":"Paramaribo, often called Par'bo, is the lively capital and only city of the sparsely inhabited country of Suriname. Home to about 250,000 people, or over half of the country's population, this laid-back South American gem lies just 15km from the Atlantic Ocean. It's the country's main harbour, governmental seat and centre for business and learning. Many visitors to Suriname come by here, spending some time to take in the city's pretty UNESCO World Heritage listed colonial centre. Paramaribo leads by example in Surinam's efforts to expand its tourist economy, with a strong focus on eco-friendly travel.\n","Latitude":"5.8667","Longitude":"-55.1667","Url":"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Paramaribo","Country":"Suriname"},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]
