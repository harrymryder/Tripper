The streets are now potholed, the lights no longer work and the jungle is reclaiming them in places.

It was the capital city of the French colonies in the region from 1893 until 1896, until the administration was transferred to Bingerville after a severe bout of yellow fever. The city's inhabitants recovered, and it remained a key seaport until the growth of Abidjan from the 1930s, which crushed its golden era. By independence in 1960, Grand-Bassam was little more than a ghost town, until a surge of tourism in the 1970s led to its resettlement. Today, a modest 5,000 people call the town their home, although some areas remain largely abandoned.\n","Latitude":"5.2086","Longitude":"-3.7450","Url":"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Grand-Bassam","Country":"Cote d'Ivoire","Photo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Grand-Bassam_banner_hotel_beach.jpg/2560px-Grand-Bassam_banner_hotel_beach.jpg"},{"Name":"Taï National Park","Description":"Taï National Park is in Côte d'Ivoire, in the southwest of the country about 100 km in from the coast and near the Liberian border.\n","Latitude":"5.75","Longitude":"-7.12","Url":"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Ta%C3%AF_National_Park","Country":"Cote d'Ivoire","Photo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Pagebanner_default.jpg"},{"Name":"Comoe National Park","Description":"Comoé National Park is in the Northern Savanna of Côte d'Ivoire.
