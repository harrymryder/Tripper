[{"Name":"Bogotá","Description":"Bogotá's sheer size and (outdated) violent reputation are intimidating for visitors, but the city opens up to the savvy traveler with incredible riches befitting the capital of Colombia, and one of the biggest cities in Latin America. Historic riches—its well preserved historic quarter has a good claim to be the original capital of Spanish colonial South America, as the capital of the vast New Kingdom of Granada, placed strategically close to mythical El Dorado. Artistic riches—the small historic quarter alone is home to dozens of experimental theaters, and diverse art galleries dot the most popular neighborhoods pressed against the dramatic Eastern Andes peaks. Culinary riches—its several dining districts play host to world-class restaurants representing all the world's cuisines, traditional and modern, frequented by the local jet set crowd. Rich with nightlife, the party lasts well into the night at sweaty salsa clubs, English pubs, caffeinated indie rock shows, cocktail lounges, steakhouses-cum-dance parties, and amidst drawn-out conversations in coffeeshops and corner cafes in this decidedly intellectual university town known as the Athens of South America. You could see the sights in a few days, or linger for a month to live the cosmopolitan life.\n","Latitude":"4.65189","Longitude":"-74.07855","Url":"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1","Country":"Colombia","Photo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Bogota_banner.jpg"},{"Name":"Barranquilla","Description":"Barranquilla is a city on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia.\n","Latitude":"10.963889","Longitude":"-74.796389","Url":"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Barranquilla","Country":"Colombia","Photo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Barranquilla_banner.jpg"},{"Name":"Cali","Description":"Cali is a city in southwestern Colombia, capital of the Valle del Cauca department.
